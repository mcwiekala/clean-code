# Don't code! Tell the story instead!
## A few words about Clean Code in practice
 
 
A lot of developers just literally are coding the code 😧👨‍💻

Their final result is so difficult to understand that it might take a lot of time. 🕑 Good code should be descriptive and easy to understand. Like a good story! But how to achieve that? 🤔

I just have written an article about Clean Code and how to deal with legacy. 👨‍💻 It might be useful in your projects, during discussions in a team or when you have to judge code during a Code Review process. 🤝

There is a practical example there and 3 approaches of how can you tackle a problem. The first one is based on OOP the second is on Functional Programming. The last one is a combination of both. 😮
